# Netflix Data Analysis
A simple analysis tool for getting an in depth look at your Netflix viewing habits. The current version is not finished, and many features will be reworked/added in the near future.

The current version does not automatically start a local server on launch and is a simplified version of what will be the finished product.

Feel free to take the code of the project and do whatever you please with it.


## Prerequisites 
* [Python 3.11.2](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
* A supported version of the [.NET Framework](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet-framework).

## Install and use guide
1. Download the code and unzip it.
2. In your command prompt navigate to Netflix-Data-Analysis/Python-API and run `python app.py`. This will start a local API server allowing the program to communicate with the Python backend. Alternatively you can open `app.py` in your IDE and run the file.
3. Run the `.exe` and use the program, you can input your ViewingActivity file and let the program do the rest.
